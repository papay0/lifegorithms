description: "My first full year living in San Francisco"

I'm writing this article a bit late (a year late…) so it will just be about sharing photos and less reflection based.

## January

I started the year in Bandol, France. Lots of good food (raclette) and with my dad we rented for the first time two electric mountain bikes. This thing is a monster of power, super nice & effortless, and very fun!

## February

February 2nd, Gabin (my nephew) was born! I was waiting for him to be born to go back to the US! He has such tiny fingers 🥹

## March

More baby content, I'm trying to feed him [Lu Petit Ecolier](https://www.amazon.com/LU-Cookies-Schoolboy-Chocolate-5-29-Ounce/dp/B0019FM36Y) but he didn't seem to be very interested!

It was time for me to go back to the country I'm trying to call my new home. To go back it was a crazy story about VISA. Covid was still a thing, I had to write a letter to the US government to explain why I'm special, why me being in the US territory would benefit the US economy. My argument was that I was a Lead Engineer at UberEats and without UberEats, Americans wouldn't be able to receive their groceries, and being in the same timezone would be better for me to manage all my projects.

Therefore I need to be in the US to save the US economy. LOL it worked, so they gave me a special pass to cross the border, that was pretty stressful.

After a few days in Paris, I was back in SF, visiting some places and fell in love with my new apartment in [Jasper](https://www.rentjasper.com/)!

## April

I received my [VanMoof](https://www.vanmoof.com/en-US)!! By far the best way to get around San Francisco!

Visited Las Vegas, Zion, and Bryce canyon for the first time, for my bday!

Then instead of flying back to SF, I changed my flight and stayed a few weeks in New Mexico.

## May

May was a lot of exploration! Exploring Berkeley: Indian Rock, Berkeley Rose Garden.

First Dipsea Trail! My all-time favorite hike around SF!

And finally, first time in Napa! 🍇 Looks so similar to Bandol (France) where I grew up!

## June

I tried going surfing in Pacifica. First and probably the last time. I'm the one on the left, on the ground, almost dying from the cold. It was SO WINDY!!

I also passed my Californian driver's license. It's kinda funny because I went to the driver's license driving my own car I rented using my French driver's license, lol...

Went on a hike with my friend Eoin, you might recognize him (or not) because we were interning at IBM together in Dublin in 2016.

## July

More hikes and explorations around San Francisco!

I flew to NYC but it was SO HOT that we decided to rent a car and drive to the freshwater of Niagara Falls! I'm glad I saw the falls once in my life, but that's kinda a long drive...

And then visiting NYC for a few days! What a beautiful city...

Finally, back in SF, first time trying bouldering with the team!! Fun times!

## August

My first SF bike party! Hundreds of people are biking around the city, with lights and music!

First time at [Church of 8 Wheels](http://www.churchof8wheels.com/)!

UberEats alumni event, even tho I was still at UberEats...

Back to Hawaii!! 🏄‍♂️

## September

End of Hawaii trip, back to SF!

Nothing crazy happened, but that team dinner was pretty good! 😋

## October

Hiking in Tiburon!

Ultimate frisbee, Warriors game, yaaaaay!

## November

Benji 🐶 is more and more present in my life!

I get featured into the famous journal [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/campus/article/2021/11/26/entre-coup-de-bol-et-mauvaise-fortune-les-tribulations-d-un-ingenieur-francais-aux-etats-unis_6103665_4401467.html) 😁

Nice bday party in front of the Palace of Fine Arts

## December

More friends and dogs 🙂

First time skiing in Palisades Tahoe!

More Benji!

Almost the last meal of the year, a good raclette 🧀!
