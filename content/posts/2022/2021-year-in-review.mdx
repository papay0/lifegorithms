I'm writing this article a bit late (a year late…) so it will just be about sharing photos and less reflection based.

## January

<ImageGrid images={["/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled_(1).jpeg","/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled_(3).jpeg","/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled_(2).jpeg"]} cols={3} />

I started the year in Bandol, France. Lots of good food (raclette on the picture) and with my dad we rented for the first time two electric mountain bikes. This thing is a monster of power, super nice & effortless, and very fun!

## February

<ImageGrid images={["/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled_(4).jpeg","/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled_(5).jpeg","/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled_(6).jpeg","/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled_(7).jpeg"]} cols={3} />

February 2nd, Gabin (my nephew) was born! I was waiting for him to be born to go back to the US! He has such tiny fingers 🥹

## March

<ImageGrid images={["/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled_(8).jpeg","/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled_(9).jpeg","/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled_(10).jpeg","/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled_(11).jpeg"]} cols={3} />

More baby content, I'm trying to feed him [Lu Petit Ecolier](https://www.amazon.com/LU-Cookies-Schoolboy-Chocolate-5-29-Ounce/dp/B0019FM36Y) but he didn't seem to be very interested!

It was time for me to go back to the country I'm trying to call my new home. To go back it was a crazy story about VISA. Covid was still a thing, I had to write a letter to the US government to explain why I'm special, why me being in the US territory would benefit the US economy. My argument was that I was a Lead Engineer at UberEats and without UberEats, Americans wouldn't be able to receive their groceries, and being in the same timezone would be better for me to manage all my projects.
Therefore I need to be in the US to save the US economy. LOL it worked, so they have me a special pass to cross the border, that was pretty stressful. Once the pass received, I had max 30 days to cross the border, otherwise it would expire!

After a few days in Paris, I was back in SF, visiting some places and fell in love with my new apartment in [Jasper](https://www.rentjasper.com/)!

## April

I received by [VanMoof](https://www.vanmoof.com/en-US)!! By far the best way to get around San Francisco!

Visited Las Vegas, Zion, and Bryce canyon for the first time, for my bday!

Then instead of flying back to SF, I changed my flight and stayed a few weeks in New Mexico.

## May

May was a lot of exploration! Exploring Berkeley, Indian Rock on the left, berkeley rose garden on the right.

<ImageGrid images={["/images/2021-year-in-review/IMG_8268.jpg","/images/2021-year-in-review/IMG_8206.heic","/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled.jpeg"]} cols={3} />

I tried going surging in Pacifica. First and probably the last time. I'm the one on the left, on the ground, almost dying from the cold. It was SO WINDY!!

I also passed my Californian driver's license. It's kinda funny because I went to the driver's license driving my own car I rented using my French driver's license, lol…

Went on a hike with my friend Eoin, you might recognize him (or not) because we were interning at IBM together in Dublin in 2016. ([article](https://lifegorithms.com/ibm-extreme-blue-2016-internship))

## July

I flew to NYC but it was SO HOT that we decided to rent a car and drive to the freshwater of Niagara Falls! I'm glad I saw the falls once in my life, but that's kinda a long drive…

<ImageGrid images={["/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled_9.jpeg","/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled_10.jpeg","/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled_11.jpeg","/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled_12.jpeg","/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled_13.jpeg","/images/2021-year-in-review/Untitled_14.jpeg"]} cols={3} />
