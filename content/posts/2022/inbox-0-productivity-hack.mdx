Inbox 0 is by far my most powerful productivity hack.

With Inbox 0, you will never miss an email ever again & you will feel more productive than ever!

The goal is to always have 0 emails in your inbox.

## What are the benefits?

Inbox Zero allows you to quickly and efficiently deal with every email that comes into your inbox. Once it's been dealt with, it's out of sight and out of mind--meaning you can get back to work on the stuff that matters without having email in the back of your mind.

## Can I just mark it as read?

**No Way!**

They will still appear in your inbox, you will waste valuable brainpower scanning them.

It's hard to know what is read (but spam) and read (but important).

## I LIKE IT, WHAT'S THE TRICK??!

Read this flow chart and I'll explain, it's simple.

### The Process

1. **Does it require an action?**
   - For example, spam, an email not related to any of your projects doesn't require an action.
   - But an email directly addressed to you probably does.

2. **Does it take more than 2 minutes?**
   - "2 minutes" actually depends on your context-switching skills. For some people it's 2 minutes, for some people it's more or less.
   - It means that if you spend 2 minutes doing something else than your current flow, it won't prevent you to get back into it once you're done with the 2-minute task.

3. **Can you do it now?**
   - If you can, then just do it! Why not?!
   - If you can't because you're busy with something else, then **SNOOZE IT**.
   - On Gmail, you can snooze to a later date, the email will automatically come back to you.

## First step

The first step is to start fresh, reaching 0 emails can be done by following [those steps](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/gmail-archive-inbox-zero/). ("How to Archive Everything in Gmail")

On Gmail, archived emails:
- aren't automatically deleted
- can be searched

Once this is done, the fun can begin!

## Conclusion

Inbox 0 is awesome because if you follow those simple steps, it will free all your inbox and you won't have to use your brain power to know what to work on, what to prioritize, etc.

It's really a mindset shift, but you will see that it's easier than you think. You will feel so good to see 0 emails at the end of your day. I personally do it multiple times a day to make sure I'm always on top of my emails.

I do the same with Slack, and use [https://day2day.me/](https://day2day.me/) for anything else other than emails & Slack!
