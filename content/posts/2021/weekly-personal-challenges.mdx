I decided to challenge myself on a weekly basis.
This article will describe the different challenges that I’m doing, explain why I do them and what I learned.

Please text me if you have ideas of challenges for the following weeks!

## Morning Workout Routine
_08/19/21 to 08/26/21 extended until Sept 2nd_  

Last year I went to Hawaii and I started learning how to surf. I LOVED IT. Such a beautiful activity!  
After 2 days of surfing I was sore, abs, plenty of sore muscles. I was just not ready from that.

I'm going back to Hawaii in a few days for 2 weeks and I do plan to spend lots of time surfing.  
That's why my next challenge is about working out those muscles so I can be (more) ready!

I will be doing _at least_ 20 pushups, 1 minute plank, squats and abs, every morning.  
I know what you think: "But Arthur, that's nothing!". Well, trust me, that's better than nothing!

I'll be tracking my pushups and plank with an amazing app I wrote a few years ago called `Pushups Master`.  
You can download it [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pushups-master/id1344312940) on iOS and [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pushups.master.exporeactnative) on Android!

I will be posting my results at the end of the challenge, stay tuned!

As expected, it wasn't too hard. The good thing is that it creates a good habit of waking up, doing something related to a workout, even if it's small.  
I will extend this challenge by 1 week and double the workout, doing `40 pushups` and `2 minutes plank`.

See you in a week!

## Drink 2L of water a day ❌
_08/02/21 to 08/09/21_  

I realized that I was peeing was less often than other people, which reminded me that I was drinking way less water than I should.

My challenge was to drink 2L of water a day, or about 0.5 gallons a day.  
I think I succeeded most days, but I remember 1 or 2 days I didn’t do it.  
A friend even gave me this giant 3.5L bottle to help me with this challenge!

### How did that happen?
I might have succeeded in the challenge if I take into account the glasses of water I drank at lunchtime at the office, but I wanted to drink 4 times my 0.5L bottle per day, which at some point did not happen.   
I’m really not used to drinking that amount of water. Because it’s not natural, it felt very forced to drink a full bottle every few hours.

### What did I learn?
Drinking more water ⇒ peeing more often. LOL okay, I knew that already.  
The difference is that now I experienced it.  
Creating a habit of drinking more water is hard.

### What’s the conclusion?
I’m now drinking more water, I don’t think I’m still at the level I should be at but I now have my bottle or glass on my desk when I work, which is a `win`!

## Screentime Challenge ✅
_07/26/21 to 08/02/21_  

I realized that I was spending way too much time on my phone, endlessly scrolling on Twitter, Instagram, etc. I was averaging about 5 hours a day.  

5 hours sounds like a lot, but it goes up really fast!  
I would advise you to check it out for yourself: `Settings ⇒ Screen Time`. Answering a few messages here and there throughout the day & it’s already 2 hours!  

My challenge was to do under 2 hours a day for a week.  
I ended up doing 1 hour 9 minutes, what a success! 🥳

### How did that happen?
I simply didn’t use my phone, meaning it was staying in my bag during the workday at the office & it was staying in my room during the evening!  
I really felt like I didn’t have a phone, and also felt disconnected.

### What did I learn?
I learned that the main issue with my screen time was about endless scrolling apps. It’s fine to go on Twitter, but scrolling for one hour is not fine!

### What’s the conclusion?
I’m back at using my phone like before except for one thing. I set a time limit for Twitter & Instagram.

### Does it work?
Well yeah, it kinda does! I do admit that sometimes I click on “Ignore limit for 15 minutes”, but my screen time decreased for sure compared to before, which is a `win`!
