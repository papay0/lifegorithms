Journey

## Day 0 · Sept 14th

I’m packing and I realized that I have only 1 short 🩳!\nIt will be very hot in all the countries I’m going to visit so I will need to do some shopping when I arrive.

Sadly, it means that it’s okay to live in San Francisco with only ONE SHORT (which I use about once a year), everything else are pants 👖!

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5265_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5267_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

I’m ready to go and ready to spend 16 hours 35m on that flight!

I’ll skip directly to Sept 16th, Sept 15th was skipped because of the timezone difference! I took off on the 14th and landed on the 16th.

## Day 1 · Sept 16th · Singapore

I landed at around 6am and went straight to the hostel. I picked that hostel because my friend Peitian and Matthew were also staying there. The fact that we were both in Singapore during the same weekend was a simple coincidence, there were there for a wedding. I saw Peitian for a bit when I arrived before they had to get ready for the wedding festivities.

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5343_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5344_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

I then went to [Gardens by the Bay](https://maps.app.goo.gl/d4XLZcEHCKauSttx6), randomly met a tourist from South Korea so we walked around for about 2 hours before having to leave to the airport back to Korea.

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5299_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5307_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5298_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5327_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

Finally had dinner to this [chicken rice place](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EfVu3n6aoYTyDer59) (apparently best place) and went back to the hostel to sleep.

![](/images/asia-2023/IMG_5347_copy.jpeg)

## Day 2 · Sept 17th · Singapore

I had lunch at this apparently very good [dim sum place](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pxRjjNqHz74uaH3y9). I was good, but nothing crazy 🥹 The line was long so maybe it’s just me and my weird taste! I ordered so many things (more than the photos), I had a hard time finishing everything!

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5357_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5356_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

After spending a few hours in [a cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5azraW6e4qB4PtJ78) to avoid the heat. It feels good to stop walking for a bit and relax, journal and write this blog!

![](/images/asia-2023/IMG_5361_copy.jpeg)

I then went to the [Singapore Botanic Gardens](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iEvTPM33PXcWdMpW6)! SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN!

Before that garden I didn’t see lots of dogs (which made me a bit sad), but turns out all the dogs are hanging out in this garden. (which brought be joy!)

The garden is located in the rich area of the city, and let me tell you it’s rich rich, not just rich. You can see in the following picture that even the 2 year old kid is driving a Maserati!

![](/images/asia-2023/IMG_5375_copy.jpeg)

I like the botanical garden in San Francisco, but really this one is next level!

People are doing picnics and relaxing and walking (with dogs). Surprisingly A LOT of people are also running, which I don’t understand because it’s 32 degree C / 90 degree F!!

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5389_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5387_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5386_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5383_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5379_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5376_copy.jpeg"]} cols={3} />

## Day 3 · Sept 18th · Singapore

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5396_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5342_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

I find it very funny that they specifically prevent people to eat Durians in the room and in the metro!

For context, durian is a fruit that smells A LOT. I had the chance to try it and let me tell you, I had the taste in my mouth for a full day even after brushing my teeth!

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5397_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/Screenshot_2023-09-18_at_1.34.54_PM_copy.jpg"]} cols={2} />

For breakfast I went to Kaya Toast which is a typical breakfast in Singapore. It’s usually toast with some sort of butter, eggs and coffee.

While walking to that breakfast spot I saw some massage chair. A nice grandpa starts to talk to me, tells me to sit and try, he gives me a $2 bill to try. ($2 / 8 minutes!)\nI tell him that it’s okay I can pay for it myself, but he insists strongly!

During the chair massage he is telling me his life, he grew up in Singapore, then moved to London and Sidney to work in restaurants.\nHe is now retired and lives in Singapore. He told me that he is bored during the day, he is spending his days alone at the mall. A bit sad. I think that’s why he wanted to pay people to have some people to talk to.

I invited him for breakfast and told him I would pay for it.\nHe refused and said he already got breakfast!

I then went to [Fort Canning Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/W6RAQKZcHsGVXK879). Also a beautiful park. I like that there are lots of big parks in the middle of the city, in the middle of big buildings. Super clean!

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5404_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5422_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5410.jpg","/images/asia-2023/FD617103-DF41-494D-872C-1FBF82394325.jpg"]} cols={2} />

After stopping at a cafe to write those lines, I’m going to [ArtScience Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kHLuu6prvAUwrGYQ8)!

There were a few exhibitions, one about the metaverse, another about NFT and AI, and one called Future World: Where Art Meets Science. I didn’t know until I went in but turns out I already went to that one in San Francisco last year!

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5433_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5450_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5440_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

I then went to a Comedy Show where I randomly met Violette, a French from Toulouse (where I studied in France) and doing a 6-month internship in Singapore!

![](/images/asia-2023/IMG_5453_copy.jpeg)

### Reflecting on Singapore
- I felt safe to walk around at any time of the day or night
- Public transportation is amazing! It’s easy, on time, clean, cheap! You can pay with your phone with Apple Pay, every cities should learn from Singapore when it comes to public transport
- Lots of parks which I liked
- People seem to like expensive clothes, I’m not sure why, are they more into fashion? Or is it just that I’m used to San Francisco with the “tech fashion” sense?
- Singapore is expensive
- The hostel was not too bad, but having my own room next will be nice
- I thought that I’d meet people in the hostel but I was wrong. People seemed to just go there to sleep and mind their own business, or they’re in groups / in a relationship and don’t really socialize outside of that group

## Day 4 · Sept 19th · Bangkok

I took an early flight to Bangkok, I didn’t sleep a lot over the past 3 days before of the jetlag.

Today is a slow day, changing country, going to that new hotel, doing some research about what to do, exploring around but overall very slow and tired.

I had dinner at the local market near my hostel, this chicken noodle cost ONLY $2 USD!!!! Insane!!!!

![](/images/asia-2023/IMG_5476_copy.jpeg)

The city seems VERY OVERWHELMING, lots of cars and bikes everywhere, noises and during this season it’s super hot and humid. I’ll do more exploration tomorrow after a good night of sleep!

## Day 5 · Sept 20th · Bangkok

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5485_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5493_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5505_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5499_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5490_copy.jpeg"]} cols={3} />

Tourist day! Starting with [The Grand Palace](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MBV7TrQQv5cXBmqC8) then [Wat Phra Chetuphon Wimon Mangkhalaram Rajwaramahawihan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1YhjuAy6Lytzy8QY7). (yeah I know, try to pronounce it!)

Why do I have this stylish elephant pants you ask?

Because there is a [dress code](https://yourthaiguide.com/dress-code-for-grand-palace-and-temples-in-and-around-bangkok/) to enter the palace! Shorts are not allowed, so they sell this cool looking pants that all tourists have 😃

Me coming back from the temples with the motorcycle taxi (Grab), they don’t give helmets!!!!ALT

## Day 6 · Sept 21st · Bangkok

More relaxing day, walking around the city, breakfast in a cool [cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RfMbTFmB8gFrH1Sq8) and massage. ($15 for 90 minutes!)

I also decided to not follow my initial plan, which was spending a few days in Phuket. Instead I’m going to Seoul, South Korea! The main reason being the rain, it’s not very fun when it’s raining, especially in a place like Phuket.

## Day 7 · Sept 22nd · Chiang Mai

I flew to Chiang Mai, had a massage ($12 for 90 minutes, price is going dooooown!) and motobike-taxi to a Dim Sum place. I ordered SO MUCH FOOD, watched a volleyball game where Thailand was playing. My dinner was only $4 🥰

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5557_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5563_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5564_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

## Day 8 · Sept 23rd· Chiang Mai

Today was about two activities:

[Elephant Jungle Sanctuary](https://elephantjunglesanctuary.com/)

Night Market

Elephant Jungle Sanctuary

This place is a sanctuary and is as ethical as we can find. They were explaining that some place use elephants for tourism, you can ride them etc, but this place was mainly to help them. Of course this is what they say, but anyway!

We learnt about their habits, the difference between elephants from Africa and from Asia. We did a few activities with them:
- We fed them
- Gave them medicine
- Took a bath with them
- Put mud on them, apparently it’s like sunscreen for them!

In order to go there we had to drive a total of 1.5 hour each way.\nA first van from Chiang Mai old town to a location. Then a all-wheel drive (AWD) vehicle from that location to the sanctuary. You can see the AWD ride on the first video!

There are two ways to feed them, you can either give the food to the elephant trunk and they will put it inside their mouth. (A)

Or, show them with a sign (put the food up), they will open their mouth and you can give them. (B)

(A)ALT(B)ALT

Night Market

Later at night after getting back, I went to this nice Saturday night market in Chiang Mai, [Wua Lai Walking Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D2tmtj2bQS92DgwS9).

This is great! So much good food everywhere, and super cheap! (We’re talking $3 for the meal)

## Day 9 · Sept 24th · Chiang Mai

Today is mainly about 3 things:

Buying a new luggage

Visit temples

Fly to Seoul, South Korea

Buying a new luggage

My currently luggage broke, good that I saw it more in advance than just before packing!\nSo I started my day with some shopping lol, and learnt a bunch about luggage materials: Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Polycarbonate (PC), ABS/PC Composite or Polypropylene (PP).

![](/images/asia-2023/IMG_5624.jpg)

The current hole was small but with some tension it was increasing, sadly!

Visit temples

But fist, some good food! A very good Pad See Ew 😋

![](/images/asia-2023/IMG_5643_copy.jpeg)

I’ve been to 3 temples, and today was VERY SUNNY and HOT!

[Wat Phra Singh Woramahawihan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PXMRQwCWFoDEmdqt9)

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5645_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5647_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5648_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5649_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5650_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5652_copy.jpeg"]} cols={3} />

[Wat Chedi Luang](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pSr4twuBcctSq7Kb8)

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5655_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5656_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5662_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5657_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

[Wat Chiang Man](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K1iw1SG5x4U6Yz9B9)

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5664_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5663_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

Fly to Seoul, South Korea

My flight is at 10.35pm from Chiang Mai and arrives around 4am in Seoul (6am local time), my Airbnb has check in at 3pm. That will be interesting!

There is no Google Maps in Korea, I’ll need to use [KakaoMap](https://map.kakao.com/), let’s see how it goes! 🥳

## Day 10 · Sept 25th · Seoul, South Korea

I arrived at 4am / 6am local time, and if you know me you know for sure that I’m the total opposite of a morning person, so that was funky!!

First thing to do after getting the luggage is to find how to reach the Airbnb/city center. I was reading a bit online and I need a T-Money card for the metro buses.

I ask a group of two Koreans where to buy this card, they show me a store.

I went to this convenience store to buy it, but I could only top up with cash. (for some useless reason, even Koreans don’t understand why)

They were waiting for me at the exit of the store to see if it was a success, SO NICE!

I went to the ATM of Bank1 (random name, you will understand), all my debit cards are declined 😭 I start to freak out a bit (also I’m super sleepy), I ask the person at the Bank1, she doesn’t speak English, great! After some language exchange, I understand that there is another bank I can take cash in the airport, Bank2.\nI arrive at Bank2, it’s written “Out Of Service, please go to Bank1”!!!!

So I go back to see the two Koreans and ask what I can do. They’re super nice, they bring me to another location of Bank1, let’s call is Bank3. Same, all my cards are declined. F*ck!

Last try, we walk to Bank4, and now it works yay! 🥳

I have cash, I can now go back to this convenience store… the cashier tells me that he just sold his last T-Money card, f*ck!!

So I try to go somewhere else, I find one, and I top up this card using my freshly baked cash 🙂

I’m now ready to go to the city center, the two Koreans told me to take that bus. I go there… I can’t use my new T-Money card, I need another ticket, a special Airport ticket 😭

![](/images/asia-2023/IMG_5699_copy.jpeg)

Anyway, I do all that, I arrive at the Airbnb. Super nice place! It’s a creator space, brand new, with a nice lobby area with couches, perfect because I arrived around 10am, and my Airbnb checkin wasn’t before 3pm!

Airbnb is located in [Hongdae area](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L5BdTTeiYGxD2XTs6), best location imo!! 10 minutes from the busy street so it’s pretty quiet!

I look for food, ask around what’s the best way to search for food. (as Google Maps doesn’t work)

I eat at this [great place](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6627VP8nbkwt84Br5), it’s a Korean Tonkatsu (Donkkaseu?), pretty good!

![](/images/asia-2023/IMG_5709_copy.jpeg)

In the lobby of the Airbnb, I hear a guy speaking in French. I start chatting with him, I ask how to meet people in Seoul, he tells me a few ways including a group called Fake Buddies.

Turns out they have an event tonight: Laser Tag! I reach out to the organizer and ask if I can join. I have 1-2 hours of sleep at this point!

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5732_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5724_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

After the event we all go for dinner together. We ate this chicken with some sort of spicy sauce, a bit too spicy for me, but well, I’m here to try new things!!

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5728_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5727_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

Walking around Hongdae, things are opened late, light rain (not disturbing rain), pleasant temperature to walk outside, feeling very safe in this city.

![](/images/asia-2023/IMG_5730_copy.jpeg)

What a successful first evening in Seoul, excited for tomorrow!

## Day 11 · Sept 26th · Seoul, South Korea

I woke up very late (sleep much needed!) and visited Hongdae.\nI like this neighborhood a lot, lots of restaurants and cafes!

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5770_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5774_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

I went to [Thanks Nature Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TL9mo1aNhXCXJb7t7), a cafe with sheeps 🐑 inside! Also this pancake was SO GOOD!

I then went to an event from Fake Buddies. I like the first so much that I signed up for 3 events this week.

![](/images/asia-2023/IMG_5778_copy.jpeg)

They have 3 special events per week and 3 regular events.

Special = laser tag, activities, hikes, museums, etc

Regular = language exchange, talking, getting to know each other, making friends

Today was a regular event, then we all went for dinner, great day & great evening, excited about the next one!

## Day 12 · Sept 27th · Seoul, South Korea

Visited Gangnam!

Do you know that name from somewhere? That’s because yes, it’s the name of video famous video [PSY - GANGNAM STYLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0)!

From internet,

What is Gangnam City famous for?

Although arguably most famous outside of Seoul as the title of Psy\'s global K-pop hit, Gangnam in Seoul (South Korea) has a unique identity of its own. This trendy neighbourhood is an urban utopia of high-end shopping, traditional temples and choice cultural spots (plus K-Pop references galore).

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5797_2.jpg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5799_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5801_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

It’s very different from what I’ve seen so far! When I came out of the metro it made me think of NYC, lots of people, lights and shops, like in Time Square.

But not everywhere, also a lot of cute cafes and cute streets.

I went to that super nice library inside a mall! It was nice to just sit and chill and people watch 🙂

![](/images/asia-2023/IMG_5802_copy.jpeg)

I had the best KBBQ ever! Unsure why it was so good, maybe because the meat was better, or maybe because it was in a different context (different country), or maybe the fire was a real fire. (instead of in San Francisco it’s usually gas!)

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5791_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5792_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

Interesting facts about the metro here.

It doesn’t make sense for many reasons (from what I know, and Koreans agreed with me):
- You can only top up your card with cash. Why? Everything else is digital in this country! So annoying.
- You need to have a sense of where you’re going to know how to use the metro. If you’re new, it’s sometimes 50/50 to know which direction you should go to. Usually in other countries they would write the name of the end line, or maybe the next stop, so you know if you should go to this or that direction. But here it’s different, they write the names of ~ famous metro stops from that line in that given direction. That’s fine if you know, but if you’re new you just have no idea of what those famous metro stops are!

People are waiting in nice line before entering the metro, and more of less waiting for people to first go out, and then they can get in. That’s nice 😊\nIn other countries (like France, or The Netherlands, or the US) people are fighting to get in first.

Lastly, EVERYONE IS CONSTANTLY ON THEIR PHONE. It’s not only in the metro, it’s everywhere, but it’s even more obvious in the metro!

## Day 13 · Sept 28th · Seoul, South Korea

Exploring Myeong-dong

Today I visited around Myeong-dong and walked around A LOT.

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5809_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5812_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5814_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5815_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

Starting with a food market called [Gwangjang Market 광장시장](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ABGwA7ry5WvzAYhS7).

It was interesting but VERY OVERWHELMING! Lots of people said it was a touristy area but it was mainly Koreans. Maybe because it was Chuseok, the ~ Korean Thanksgiving. I had a seafood pancake. I usually love it in SF, especially at [Manna](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oNN9URAMJSqMd3fc8). But this one was just okay 😕

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5816_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5821_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5818_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

I then walked around a beautiful park, [Jongmyo Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PjsVDtxXbvDasb3o8).

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5834_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5843_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5854_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5836_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5840_copy.jpeg"]} cols={3} />

Some more walking around, everything was so different and BEAUTIFUL!\nFinally finishing my walk with [Gyeongbokgung Palace](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bbf5wH1otWfDpuRC6).

Samoyed Cafe

A year or two ago I saw on Instagram a cafe full of Samoyed (a dog breed, very pretty and fluffy), it was the cutest thing! I was like, damn one day I shall go there!!

Today is the day!!!! So excited lol

I finally went to that [Samoyed Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7zb5uirJ8YMWm1qJA), they’re so nice and fluffy and pretty and cuddly and playful ❤️

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5935_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5878_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5882_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5893_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

Such a happy moments! Especially because I love dogs and I haven’t seen that many dogs since the beginning of my trip! Highly advise people to go 😃

Fake Buddies & Dinner

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5944_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5951_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5958_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5960_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

Directly after that I walked to the hangout with Fake Buddies where I saw some street performances. The session today was a regular session and then went for dinner to eat lamb skewers, SO GOOD!\nWent to the bar and left them at 3am because I was tired. When I was walking around I realized that things were still opened, this city never sleeps!

## Whooo what a day!

## Day 14 · Sept 29th · Seoul, South Korea

Last full day in Seoul! 😭\nI had such a good week, I even was thinking if I should cancel my Taiwan trip and stay more!

Today was also a holiday day for Chuseok so most restaurants were closed, I had a hard time finding where to eat for lunch. (Mcdonald\'s? 👀)

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5974_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5995_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5984_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5992_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5989_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5980_copy.jpeg"]} cols={3} />

Later in the day I went on a hike to [N Seoul Tower](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JyprHkt5Aa6SBV1y9), lots of stairs, nice exercise and good view of the city.

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_5997_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_5998_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_6003_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_6008_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_6006_copy.jpeg"]} cols={3} />

We then went clubbing, but I don’t like clubbing. So after staying 5 minutes instead, SUPER LOUD, I went out and found some friends who also were not a fan of clubs. We ended up chatting in front of the club for 4 hours. I went back very late, I was leaving the morning after to Taiwan!

I absolutely loved my time in Seoul, I’ll definitely come back.

The experience was 100x better because I met some very cool people thanks to Fake Buddies!

Also Seoul is a great city, clean, good public transportation (once you know how it works), technologically advanced, amazing good, night life if you like that!

Random facts I realized after walking around in Seoul for a few days:

🚦 When you’re a pedestrian and you’re crossing the road, it’s at the green light, right? There is a countdown from like 30 to 0, which is nice. The surprising thing is that the moment it reaches 0, it instantly becomes GREEN for the cars, and they go for it! Which means that you should 100% be on the other side by 0. In Europe and in the US, after reaching 0, there is a few seconds buffer before it turns green for the cars. Very surprised! 🚦

## Day 15 · Sept 30th · Taipei, Taiwan

Travel day. I flew to Taipei, Taiwan.

## Day 16 · Oct 1st · Taipei, Taiwan

After eating Asian food for 2 weeks I was craving something more European, I had lunch in an Italian restaurant and had pasta carbonara, in a big mall with tons of brands. I see that a lot!

After that I met up with a friend, we went to [Ningxia Night Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zHAmhEWCLsPBiFzR9).

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_6044_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_6046_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

I tried this weird thing (to me!), which is called Sishen Soup, or Four God Soup, which contains pork intestine 🙈.

It was okay but very salty! Interesting texture…

## Day 17 · Oct 2nd · Taipei, Taiwan

![](/images/asia-2023/IMG_6052_copy.jpeg)

The day started late, I was super tired from all this traveling! I was also starving but was stuck in bed because of laziness. The only thing I had was what I thought was apple sauce… so I went all in like a starving-man, but turns out it was vinegar!!!! I HATE VINEGAR, I don’t recommend this experience lol.

![](/images/asia-2023/IMG_6055_copy.jpeg)

My plan today was to have lunch, then go hiking then have dinner in a night market. First I had to buy the EasyCard, which is the transportation card in Taiwan, look at this face, how cute is it?!

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_6087_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_6081_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_6114_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_6107_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_6093_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_6089_copy.jpeg"]} cols={3} />

The hike was great! It was [Elephant Mountain Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/taiwan/taipei-city/elephant-mountain-trail--2).

It’s not very long but it’s 100% STAIRS! Super nice view on the city and on the Taipei 101, which is the tallest building in Taipei.

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/IMG_6127_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_6129_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_6130_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_6131_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

I had dinner at [Raohe Night Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/s9cKVwP2Vmvqfz1v6), had some good meat and this yummy dessert 😋

Random facts after walking around in the city for a bit:

🚦 Taipei has the worst traffic light system logic I’ve ever seen, very inefficient. Let me explain. People don’t jaywalk, they respect the rules, which is good. When the light is green, there is a count down until 0, which is good. But the countdown starts at a very high value, most of the time 80 or 90 seconds!! Which means that the other side of the crossing is stuck for 90 seconds waiting for that light to turn red. This would make sense for large traffic at big intersection, but I see it all the time at very small intersections with very few people crossing. They should do 20 seconds and alternate more often! 🚦

## Day 18 · Oct 3rd · Taipei, Taiwan

I mainly walked around the city but didn’t take photos!

I discovered Din Tai Fung (DTF) and have it for lunch! Hotpot for dinner 😋

## Day 20 · Oct 5th · Tokyo, Japan

Today I’m flying to Tokyo, Japan! Alarm 4am hurts!

The bad news is that a typhoon is coming to Taiwan!

All the flights from the south of Taiwan were canceled but my flight was okay because I flew from Taipei, so I was able to fly to Tokyo on time 🙂

![](/images/asia-2023/IMG_6162_copy.jpg)

I discovered the chain CoCo Ichibanya, which serves a few things but mainly Katsu Curry, while I love! It’s like the Chipotle of Japan for me 😋

## Day 21 · Oct 6th · Kyoto, Japan

I find this video extremely funny, such a perfect coordination!

And then we went to [cafe de monca](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7ofDn8YR9rAvdueV9), the best cafe in the world! The own has 4 golden retrievers, which are my favorite dog ever! So we spent a few hours with them, best day ever! Look at this cuteness!!!!

## Day 24 · Oct 9th · Tokyo, Japan

Back to Tokyo and [Midnight Runners](https://www.midnightrunners.com/) special event!

Midnight Runners is my (social) running club, a global running community available worldwide. So nice to be able to go to a new city and run with people and feel like we’re part of something, almost like I know them already!

## Day 25 · Oct 10th · Tokyo, Japan

Today is mainly a rest day, traveling that much is super tiring!

But, in the evening I had dinner with Melissa my Product Manager at Uber. Or should I say ex-PM because she quit Uber 2 months ago. We keep meeting in random places, in Paris, in San Mateo randomly in the streets and now in Tokyo!

<ImageGrid images={["/images/asia-2023/6F58DA0D-D51F-42A8-BA1D-541AA489CFA0_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_6426_copy.jpeg","/images/asia-2023/IMG_6429_copy.jpeg"]} cols={2} />

## Day 26 · Oct 11th · Tokyo, Japan

I spent the day in a Hakone for a day trip to go to an Onsen (Hot Spring Baths).

Interesting experience, and the place is beautiful, would recommend!

It took me about 3 hours to go there and 2.5 to come back, so I’d advise to spend the night there, go to the Onsen and also explore Hakone, apparently it’s beautiful 🙂

Back to San Francisco!

![](/images/asia-2023/IMG_6581_copy.jpeg)

Wow what a trip!

It felt both short and long at the same time. I’m glad I did this trip, discovered all those new countries and met those new friends.

Now is time to reflect, process, and … no, just kidding, I need to work tomorrow morning 🥲
