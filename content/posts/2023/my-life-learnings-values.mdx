Most of the article will be about how I see life as a composition of algorithms, how that helps me to make decisions, and how/why I communicate effectively with people around me.

Communication is SO IMPORTANT. This is the foundation of the society we live in.\nIt allows us to connect, understand each other, build trust, etc.\nWe should at least make sure that the people involved in a given situation are on the same page, by clearly expressing our needs, our thoughts, and giving heads up, all of which will prevent misunderstanding.

I came to realize that life is so much easier when people try to understand before judging. It gives a feeling of being safe, safe of expressing whatever we have in mind.

Thinking logically and using a decision tree helps me to make better decisions.

## Life is just an algorithm

I see life as an algorithm. Every decision we make moves us from one node to another in a giant graph as illustrated in the image below.

We can't control the past. (so no need to worry about that!) But we can control the present by making decisions. Let's zoom in on the green dot "your life today" and see how we can simplify the process of making a decision.

### Using a decision tree to help make decisions

A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences.

For simple or complex decisions, I always visualize the decision process with a decision tree. Let’s take an example to better understand what I mean.

Let’s say a friend asks me “Do you want to come to watch a movie tonight at 9 pm?”. I need to answer yes or no. Here is a simple case:

Which could be summarized as Yes I’m coming if I’m free.

In general, decisions are more complex and depend on other external factors, let‘s see a more complex example, still using the movie:

This could be summarized as Yes I’m coming if I’m free and if I’m done with work and if I have time to pick up my bike from the garage first.

This is just an example showing how decisions are driven by conditions, and most conditions can be written as nodes in a tree. Sometimes the tree is way bigger, then it becomes interesting to better understand/visualize all the conditions that could lead to a yes, or a no.

### Saying "Maybe" as an answer is not enough

Too many people are answering “Maybe” when they’re asked a question. Maybe doesn’t bring a lot of value! If I ask you Are you coming to the movie at my place tonight? and you tell me Maybe, how do I know if I should count you in or not??! Should I invite someone else??

That’s why I always try my best to answer either YES or NO. If I don’t know the answer yet (because it depends on other things, not in my control), I try my best to explain the condition. For instance, I’m coming to movie night if I’m done with work and I have time to first pick up my bike from the garage. I will let you know by 8 pm. It’s always good to provide a timeline, so they know that if no answer by 8 pm, they should count it as a NO.

People usually do it in the work context, but less so on the day to day life.

For instance in the work context, if your product manager asks you “Are you going to launch the feature next Monday?”, I’m sure you wouldn’t answer “Maybe.”

But you would probably answer "(Maybe,) I will launch it if I can finish task A and task B. If not, the feature will probably be launched next Monday as long as I'm done with those two tasks".

## What's the worst-case scenario?

This question helps me a lot! If the worst-case scenario is okay, then the full situation will be okay, no need to stress or worry!

Let’s take the example of going on a date, which could be a stressful situation.

What are the possible outcomes?

- I don’t have a good time, it’s a waste of time for both of us
- Have an okay time, I get to know someone new but I won’t see this person ever again
- Have a good time, no romantic chemistry, but I do have a new friend yaaay!
- Have a very good time, I want to see this person again, who knows what will happen 🙂

What's the worst-case scenario? "Waste of time for both of us". Yes, that sucks, but is it really that bad? As long as I'm okay & aware that this situation might happen, then it's okay! The worst-case scenario, by definition: is the worst and nothing worst can happen. So if I'm okay with this scenario it's amazing, everything else will be better, such good news! I might have a new friend or more!

## Giving heads up

Again, it's all about being on the same page and avoiding misunderstanding, and respecting the other person.

Let’s say you’re supposed to meet a friend at 5 pm, but you’re running late. It’s fine to be late, we all have a life, last-minute things, or unexpected traffic. But at least try to update your friend as early as possible so he/she can plan accordingly.

Hey, heads up I’m running 15 minutes late I’m really sorry!

This doesn’t take a lot of time to send, and is very useful for the other person!

A good solution (if you trust your friend enough) is to share your location. So at least your friend knows how far you are and there might be no need to ask “Hey are you coming soon?”.

By doing so, you show that you respect your friend's time.

## Never go to sleep with something on your mind

This works for more general situations (for instance at work) but I’ll use the example of a romantic partner.

If I have something on my mind, I’ll try to bring it up with that person as early as possible and try to openly talk about it.

Let's say my partner did something that upsets me. It's very easy to keep it to myself, keep it on my mind and not say anything. She might not even know that this was upsetting to me!\nI will start guessing "why did she do that?", and try to find reasons, which could be correct… or wrong!\nThis small thing, plus another one, plus another one, might just add up and become something bigger even tho it might just be based on a big misunderstanding.\nInstead, bringing up the worry to her as early as possible might solve everything. We will have an open and non-violent communication, not judging, making sure everyone feels safe. We will probably both learn something and at the end of the day everyone will sleep better! 🙂
