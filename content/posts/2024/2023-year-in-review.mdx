Uber holiday party at [de Young Museum](https://www.famsf.org/) in San Francisco, pretty fun night!

![](/images/2023-year-in-review/FullSizeRender.heic)

Spent 3 weeks in France for the holidays with family and friends 🥰

<ImageGrid images={["/images/2023-year-in-review/IMG_0992.jpg","/images/2023-year-in-review/IMG_1048.jpg","/images/2023-year-in-review/IMG_0934.jpg","/images/2023-year-in-review/IMG_1030.jpg","/images/2023-year-in-review/IMG_1064.jpg","/images/2023-year-in-review/IMG_1081.jpg","/images/2023-year-in-review/IMG_0997.jpg","/images/2023-year-in-review/IMG_1005_copy.jpeg"]} cols={3} />

I test-drove the car that I think I wanted because this model is not available in the US yet, but available in France. It confirmed that I really like it, and the color, and I feel good inside, so I'm excited to have it and go on more adventures and unlock more freedom!

## Reflection

### How was it?

It might not have been my best year, but 2023 confirmed what makes me happy: good time with friends.

I feel lucky that I found two great communities, Midnight Runners and Ultimate Frisbee ❤️

Work hasn't been super fulfilling.

I met some new friends and continued building friendships with others.
I'm a bit sad that SF is such a transient city, people are usually not staying for a long long time, especially when they're reaching 30+ years old.

I also spend > 365 days without drinking one drop of alcohol, as a personal chalenge. Which was pretty easy because I was almost not drinking before.

### What makes me happy?
- Midnight Runners
- Ultimate Frisbee
- Good time with great people
- Spontaneous trips
- Skiing
- Creating (usually through coding)
- DOGS 🥰

### What do I want to focus on in 2024?

I will buy a car which will give me more freedom.
I would like to do more day/weekend trips and explore more of the Bay Area.

I will go skiing, but differently than in 2023. I will go less times, maybe for a longer period. For instance 2 or 3 trips of 5 days instead of doing many weekend trips.

I will continue to go to Midnight Runners every Wednesday, it's a good workout, it's social, it's outside, it's perfect! Same for Ultimate Frisbee. I'll keep prioritizing those two activities on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

Related to alcohol, I might drink sometimes for special events, for instance, if I travel to another country and there is a special alcohol there, worth trying, I'll most likely try it. But I don't think I'd go back to ordering a full glass at the bar when I go out.

I will be even more intentional about my time, what I want to do, how I achieve those goals, etc.
