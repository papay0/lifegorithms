Welcome to the new version of Lifegorithms! This blog has been rebuilt from the ground up using modern web technologies to provide a better reading experience.

## What's New?

This new version of the blog comes with several improvements:

- **Faster Performance**: Built with Next.js 16 and server-side rendering for optimal speed
- **Better Reading Experience**: Clean, minimal design focused on content
- **MDX Support**: I can now embed interactive React components directly in my posts
- **Search**: Quickly find articles with the search feature (try pressing `⌘K`)
- **Tags & Categories**: Better organization and discoverability of content

## Technical Stack

For the technically curious, here's what powers this blog:

- **Next.js 16**: React framework with excellent SSR/SSG support
- **MDX**: Markdown with React components
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development

```typescript
// Example: Type-safe blog post interface
interface Post {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  emoji?: string;
  date: string;
  tags?: string[];
  content: string;
}
```

## Features to Explore

### Draft Mode

Posts can be marked as drafts and won't be visible to the public until published. This allows me to work on articles over time before sharing them.

### Tags & Categories

Each post can have multiple tags, making it easier to find related content. You'll see tags displayed on both the homepage and individual post pages.

### SEO Optimization

All posts are optimized for search engines with proper meta tags, Open Graph, and Twitter Cards.

## What's Next?

I'm excited to continue sharing my thoughts and experiences here. You can expect posts about:

- Technology and software engineering
- Life lessons and personal growth
- Travel experiences
- Year-in-review reflections

Stay tuned for more content!
